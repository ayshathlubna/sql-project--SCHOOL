# sql-project--SCHOOL

Welcome to the School Database Project! This project is a part of my SQL learning journey where I have created a comprehensive database to practice SQL queries and explore various SQL topics.

## Project Overview
### Database Creation
I have designed and implemented a database to manage school-related information. This includes various entities that are essential for a school's operations.

### Tables
The database consists of the following 10 tables:

1. **Students**
2. **Classes**
3. **Parents**
4. **Subjects**
5. **Student_Parent**
6. **Staff**
7. **Staff_Salary**
8. **Address**
9. **School**
10. **Student_Classes**


### Data Insertion : 
I have populated the tables with data for around 1000 students, ensuring a robust dataset for practicing SQL queries.

### SQL Operators and CASE Statements
SQL Operators: Utilized various SQL operators to filter, sort, and manipulate data.
CASE Statements: Implemented conditional logic to enhance data queries.

## Upcoming Projects
I will continue to use this database in future projects to explore more advanced SQL commands and functions. Stay tuned for more updates!
