# sql-project--SCHOOL

Welcome to the School Database Project! This project is a part of my SQL learning journey where I have created a comprehensive database to practice SQL queries and explore various SQL topics.

Project Overview
Database Creation
I have designed and implemented a database to manage school-related information. This includes various entities that are essential for a school's operations.

Tables
The database consists of the following 10 tables:

Students
Classes
Parents
Subjects
Student_Parent
Staff
Staff_Salary
Address
School
Student_Classes
Data Insertion
I have populated the tables with data for around 1000 students, ensuring a robust dataset for practicing SQL queries.

SQL Operators and CASE Statements
SQL Operators: Utilized various SQL operators to filter, sort, and manipulate data.
CASE Statements: Implemented conditional logic to enhance data queries.
Upcoming Projects
I will continue to use this database in future projects to explore more advanced SQL commands and functions. Stay tuned for more updates!
